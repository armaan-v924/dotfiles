# Neovim Configuration

Goal: minimal, modular, tmux-aligned Neovim setup that is easy to extend.

## Structure

```
config/nvim/
├── init.lua                # bootstrap + high-level options
├── lazy-lock.json          # plugin lockfile (generated by lazy.nvim)
└── lua/dotfiles/
    ├── core/               # options, autocmds, keymaps
    ├── plugins/            # lazy.nvim specs (per-feature modules)
    ├── utils/              # helper functions
    └── overlay.lua         # loads overlay-provided extensions (if any)
```

Plugins are declared under `lua/dotfiles/plugins/` (one file per concern, e.g., `lsp.lua`, `telescope.lua`). lazy.nvim auto-installs itself and the listed plugins on first launch.

## Principles

* Prefer defaults; only configure what improves ergonomics.
* Leader is `<Space>` with which-key grouping for discoverable keybinds.
* LSPs are managed by Mason; inline diagnostics are enabled by default.
* Color palette matches tmux/starship (dark background, subtle accents).
* Overlays may extend functionality by hooking `lua/dotfiles/overlay.lua`.

## Extending

1. Add a spec under `lua/dotfiles/plugins/` or edit an existing one.
2. Keep specs self-contained (plugin + config + keymaps).
3. Run `:Lazy sync` inside Neovim to apply changes.
4. Commit updated `lazy-lock.json` so plugin versions remain deterministic.
