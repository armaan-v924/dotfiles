# Setup Scripts

Scripts in this directory are **interactive** and **environment-specific**.

They are intentionally NOT run by bootstrap.

Use these scripts to:
- set git identity
- generate SSH keys
- configure GPG
- apply machine- or work-specific settings

Run them manually when setting up a new environment.
